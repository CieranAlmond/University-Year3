Strategy 1

State is 0 (selfish miner lead is 0) at initiation, so are at equality between both branches
In the instance of equality, gamma will mine on the selfish miners chain, 1-gamme wont..

When State is >2 selfish miners have a lead of n+2 ahead of honest miners and keep mining anonomously, releasing one block at
a time whenever honest miners find a block..

State < 0. selfish adopt the public chain, as honest miners are 1 block ahead, selfish miners dont want to waste computational power.

State = 1. honest miners can either catch up to be 1 block behind selfish miner, or selfish miners get to state State >2. in the instance
of the former case, selfish miners will publish their chain to ensure computational resources arent wasted, in the case State reaches 0.

These definitions will be used for development of selfish_mine.py and selfish_mining_simulator.py


Strategy 2 (SELFISH MINER ATTEMPTS TO CATCH UP ON A 2 BLOCK DEFICIT AGAINST THE HONEST CHAIN)


State is 0 (selfish miner lead is 0) at initiation, so are at equality between both branches
In the instance of equality, gamma will mine on the selfish miners chain, 1-gamma wont..

When State is >2 selfish miners have a lead of n+2 ahead of honest miners and keep mining anonomously, releasing one block at
a time whenever honest miners find a block..


State < 0. *STRATEGY* selfish DONT adopt the public chain, honest miners are 1 block ahead, selfish miners try to catch up to the selfish miners chain, even if they are two blocks behind

The results will be compared against those of Strategy 1

State = 1. honest miners can either catch up to be 1 block behind selfish miner, or selfish miners get to state State >2. in the instance
of the former case, selfish miners will publish their chain to ensure computational resources arent wasted, in the case State reaches 0.


Strategy 3 (SELFISH MINERS DONT PUBLISH A BLOCK WHEN State > 2 AND AN HONEST MINER FINDS A BLOCK)
(INSTEAD SELFISH MINERS PUBLISH THEIR CHAIN ONLY WHEN THEY ARE 3 BLOCKS AHEAD OF THE HONEST CHAIN)?

State is 0 (selfish miner lead is 0) at initiation, so are at equality between both branches
In the instance of equality, gamma will mine on the selfish miners chain, 1-gamma wont..

When State is >2 selfish miners have a lead of n+2 ahead of honest miners and keep mining anonomously, *STRATEGY*

When State is NEW STATE selfish miners are forced to publish their rewards once they are 3 blocks ahead of the Honest Miners chain.

State < 0. selfish adopt the public chain, as honest miners are 1 block ahead, selfish miners dont want to waste computational power.

State = 1. honest miners can either catch up to be 1 block behind selfish miner, or selfish miners get to state State >2. in the instance
of the former case, selfish miners will publish their chain to ensure computational resources arent wasted, in the case State reaches 0.
