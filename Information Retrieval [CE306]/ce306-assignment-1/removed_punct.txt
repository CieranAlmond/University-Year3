conjunction with the 42nd European Conference on Information Retrieval  ECIR2020 TopicsThere is an increasing interest in exploiting the vast amount of rapidly growing content related to health by means of information retrieval and deep learning strategies  Health related content is particularly challenging  due to the very specialized domain language  implicit differences in language characteristics depending on the content type  patient generated content like discussion forum  blogs and other Internet sources  healthcare documentation and clinical records  professional or scientific publications  clinical practice guidelines  clinical trials documentation  etc    Moreover  it is also critical to provide search solutions for non English content as well as cross language or multilingual IR solutions This workshop will be a forum where the community can present and discuss current and future directions for the area based on the experience and results obtained in the BioASQ task  Moreover  the workshop proposal  in addition to the MESINESP  http   temu bsc es mesinesp   session  will include an Open Session covering IR technologies for heterogeneous health related content open to multiple languages with a particular interest in the exploitation of structured controlled vocabularies and entity linking  Among the proposed topics for this open session are  multilingual and non English health related IR  concept indexing and text categorization strategies generation of evaluation resources for biomedical document IR strategies scalability  robustness and reproducibility of health and biomedical IR and text mining resources use of specialized machine translation and advanced deep learning approaches for improving health related search results medical Question Answering search tools retrieval of multilingual health related web content and other related topics Submission Details for Open SessionAll submissions must be written in English following

IssueThe planned workshop functions as a venue for the different types of contributors  mainly task providers and solution providers  to meet together and exchange their experiences We expect that investigation on the topics of the task will continue after the workshop  based on new insights obtained through discussions during the workshop As a venue to compile the results of the follow up investigation  a journal special issue will be organized to be published a few months after the workshop  The specific journal will be announced after negotiation with publishersOrganizersMartin
